### Using Signatures for Message Authentication

This document covers how to use signatures, both for signing the messages you send and verifying that incoming webhooks have a correct signature. You can use signatures with the Submit SMS, Message API, Confirm API, Short URL API, etc., when sending requests and receiving webhooks.

### Purpose of Signatures

You use a signature to:

- **Verify** that a request originates from a trusted source.
- **Ensure** that the message has not been tampered with en-route.
- **Defend** against interception and later replay.

### Generating Signatures

When sending, you generate a signature to send with your message.

### Validating Signatures

When receiving, the incoming webhook will include the signature and all the fields you need to generate the signature in your application to verify that the two signatures match.

### Encoding

All requests should be encoded using the **UTF-8 Charset**.

**Note: All timestamps in this document are in UTC+00:00**.
